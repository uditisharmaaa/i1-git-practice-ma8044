## The Twelve-Factor App

**Link:** https://12factor.net/

The Twelve-Factor App is a set of principles for building modern, scalable, and maintainable software applications, especially those deployed in cloud environments. It outlines best practices around configuration management, dependency isolation, logging, and deployment, all of which are critical when building production-ready systems.

What I find particularly interesting about this article is how practical and timeless the principles are. Even though it was originally written for web applications, the ideas apply broadly across different tech stacks and architectures. Concepts like strict separation of config from code and treating logs as event stream are still highly relevant today and help teams avoid common pitfalls as systems grow in complexity.
